# What is a moral inventory?
A moral inventory is a list of decisions (big or small) you've made in your life and how you feel about them afterwards. The goal of a moral inventory is to be brutally honest with yourself. Writing a moral inventory should force you to reflect on what you've done well in life so far, and what you've done poorly.

# Why would I write a moral inventory?
Because it makes you see yourself more clearly. I view a moral inventory as a kind of mirror that allows you to reflect on what you're doing well and what you'd like to improve.

# What's mine?
I'm hesitant to share this publically since I think moral inventories are meant for private improvement, not public consumption. But in the hopes of being honest with myself (and also because I don't think it's very likely anyone will ever read this) here goes:

decisions i am proud of:
------------------------
- apologizing to Lauren and Mom in college
- breaking up with Abby
- teaching myself programming
- breaking up with Hannah :/
- going to Europe a couple summers ago and just having a blast
- reading every day
- going to therapy in high school
- staying in contact with Coop
- staying in contact with Erik
- taking drugs
- staying in shape


decisions i regret:
-------------------
- turning on Mihai after I was uncomfortable during halloween without ever explaining why
- calling the dragonboat instructor something like an oceanic gordon ramsey, it was a bad joke
- not travelling abroad during school
- the way things ended with Erin
- dating Kendall immediately after breaking up with Abby
- letting my clarinet skills get rusty
- general fiscal irresponsibility
- making fun of Erik
- not stretching
