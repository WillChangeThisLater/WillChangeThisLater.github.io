title: How I use LLMs to code on the command line
---
## Prompting
### Humble beginnings
I start by just asking `lm` something directly from stdin

```bash
echo "Add a function that will compute the fibonacci sequence: $(cat -n math_functions.py)" | ./lm
```

### The simplest script
If I catch my self doing this more than a couple times, I will make a bash
script, which I usually call `prompt.sh`. All `prompt.sh` ever does is generate
a prompt for `lm` to consume. That's it.

Most of these `prompt.sh` scripts start simple enough 

```prompt.sh
#!/bin/bash

# I set this on all my scripts.
# See http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/ for why.
set -euo pipefail

main() {
	cat <<EOF
I have this script: $(cat -n math_functions.py)

(I insert the rest of the prompt here)
EOF
}

main
```

### Add an `about` section
On larger projects, this gets annoying. So I'll create a helper
function that gives me context about the project:

```prompt.sh
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

# files-to-prompt is a slick Simon Willison invention
# https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt
about() {
	cat <<EOF
Vault is a CLI tool for performing embedding and vector search locally.

Here is the current directory structure:

\`\`\`bash
$(tree)
\`\`\`

And here are the current contents of the project (ignoring prompt.sh,
which is used to define this prompt):

$(files-to-prompt . --ignore "prompt.sh")
EOF
}

main() {
    cat <<EOF
Here is information about my project:

$(about)

Generate a README
EOF

}
```

### Add a `references` section using `lynx`
One of my common use cases for `prompt.sh` is for building out features. It turns
out LLMs are really bad at this in a vacuum. The documentation they were trained
on is outdated, they don't always think everything through, etc. I like to
fix this error by sending them webpages containing useful information.
Normally this is really annoying (I love `cURL` but hate seeing HTML over plaintext).
Luckily `lynx` comes to the rescue. The relevant command is:

```bash
lynx -dump -nolist https://www.hackernews.com
```

I like to use it like this:

```prompt.sh
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

references() {
	cat <<EOF

EOF
}

about() {
	cat <<EOF

\`\`\`

    cat <<EOF

$(about)

Implement a DuckDB client that does vector search.
Make sure to use the following references.

References:

$(references)
EOF
}
```

### Add error handling
This workflow already gets me surprisingly far! Providing reference docs seems to
guide the model to making better decisions. That said, sometimes I
get annoying failures. 

```
$ ./vault.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/paul.wendt/vault/./vault.py", line 169, in <module>
    db_client.search_similar_embeddings("test-model", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], top_k=1)
  File "/Users/paul.wendt/vault/./vault.py", line 90, in search_similar_embeddings
    result = self.connection.execute(query, (query_embedding, top_k)).fetchall()
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: No function matches the given name and argument types 'array_inner_product(DOUBLE[3], DOUBLE[])'. You might need to add explicit type casts.
        Candidate functions:
        array_inner_product(FLOAT[ANY], FLOAT[ANY]) -> FLOAT
        array_inner_product(DOUBLE[ANY], DOUBLE[ANY]) -> DOUBLE
```

Naturally, I have to let the LLM know. 

```prompt.sh
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

references() {
	cat <<EOF

}

run() {
	# remove the embeddings DB file if it already exists
    if [ -f "file_to_remove" ]; then
      rm "embeddings.db"
    fi

	cat <<EOF
\`\`\`bash
\$ ./vault.py
$(./vault.py 2>&1)
\`\`\`
EOF
}

about() {
	cat <<EOF

The script is failing with the following error.

Explain the error and suggest a fix, or steps to debug futher.

Make sure to use the following references:

$(references)

EOF
}
```

## Musings
### Bash as a templating language
I have a love hate relationship with bash:

Love:
  - Bash scripts are easy to spin up and can connect with everything that has a CLI
  - Bash is everywhere, so the `prompt.sh` scripts I write are portable-ish
  - Everything is text! So there's no need to worry about image output
  - `set -euo pipefail` gets reasonable-ish behavior

Hate:
  - HEREDOCS are ugly
  - Bash generally, and HEREDOCS specifically, have weird syntax quirks
  - As far as I know there's no way to build up prompts async
    For instance, I'd love to have the `references` section call out to
	lynx while the `run` section runs the script, but I don't think it's
	possible (or at the very least it's not easy) to do these at the same time

What I really want is a new programming language for prompt templating.
Templates should be pretty and sub-prompts should be able to run async.
The language will have to be powerful too - it'll probably resemble
a souped up shell more than anything
